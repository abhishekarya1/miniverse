# Introduction

This is the place where I collect notes, links, jots, and thoughts, about everything that I learn. If this is your first time here, take a look [here](meta.md) as it describes what I call - _**"The Knowledge Miniverse" or "The Compendium"**_.

## Search the Entire Compendium

You can quickly search the contents above or you can explore the tree view menu to the left.

## Other things that I do

I share my knowledge and resources by writing articles [here](https://abyssaltech.xyz).

I also love writing code and develop programs that solves various problems I have and I share them on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev).

â€‹[Here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing) you can find all the things I've made and shared thus far.

## Contributing

If you can find a mistake anywhere in this GitBook, I would really appreciate the help. You can quickly find any entry you wish to edit by [searching for the topic here](https://github.com/abhishekarya1/miniverse/find/master) and then making the changes.

I also appreciate any [ideas from your side](https://github.com/abhishekarya1/miniverse//issues/new) on how I can improve this further

## Thank You
